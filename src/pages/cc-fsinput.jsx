      <h2>Input Form</h2>
      <p>
        This challenge involved replicating the look and functionality of an input form provided in
        a gif. While most of the code was simple enough, I didn&apos;t have much experience
        implementing animation on buttons. Instead I opted to use CSS transitions to color in the
        border of the button. This challenge was done in React.

      <h2>Ruby Implementation of Erlang Code</h2>
      <p>
        This challenge involved taking the code provided in the language Erlang and recreate it in
        Ruby. I had no experience in either language so I skimmed through the Erlang docs. I also
        took some time to learn the basics of Ruby as I had planned on taking up the language it in
        the future. Turns out the logic of the code was simple enough, although I tripped over a few
        times because of syntax. This challenge was done in vanilla Ruby.
